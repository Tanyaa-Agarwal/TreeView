Parameter | Type | Description
----------|------|------------
className | string | Custom class name for the wrapping div
createItemContent | Function | Define how each item is rendered. Parameters (config, item). The first parameter passed in is the config object and the second is the item object that is currently being iterated on. It should return an HTML Element.
data| Array | Data source is a array of objects
disableAutoScroll| Boolean | Disable automatically scrolling to newly created column on parent click (default: false)
onItemSelected| Function | Callback function when item selected. Parameters: (item, domItem)
onLeafSelected| Function | Callback function when leaf node selected. Parameters: (item)
onColumnCreated| Function | Callback function when column is created. Parameters: (domColumn)
value| Object| Currently selected value. The id property is required for data lookup.

### Data

Each item in the array itself should be an object. Each object that doesn't contain a `children` property is considered a leaf node. When a leaf node is selected, the `onLeafSelected` event will be emitted. When present, the value of the `children` property should be an array. When a node has children and it is selected, it will use the `children` to populate the next column.

#### Notes

If an object has a `url` property it will be treated slightly differently: the anchor tag that wraps the item will have the `href` attribute assigned to it. Upon selection of this item the browser will be redirected to the provided URL.
